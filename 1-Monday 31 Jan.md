Reading Material
-----------------
Read the following material. File in folder: Reading Material/Emmanuel Dufourq MSC Dissertation Final.pdf

Section 3.1

Section 3.2

Section 3.3.1 to 3.3.6

Section 3.4.1

Section 3.5 to 3.5.4

Here are some important and quick material on general data science principles related to the creationg of machine learning models (like decision trees). 
The material below is quick to read so it should not take very long.

Also read the material here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets

And also here: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/training-and-test-sets/video-lecture

A video on validation data: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/validation/video-lecture

And this one, about generalisation: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/generalization/video-lecture

Finally to conclude, a small video explaining underfitting, overfitting and "just right" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnAeZ8j0Ur0

Post questions
--------------
Post any questions on slack! 

Outcomes
---------
You should be comfortable with the ability to manually compute the root node of a decision tree if a dataset is provided to you.
